# AwesomeProxy
A proxy server I made for [an assignment](http://www.cs.rochester.edu/~kshen/csc252-spring2015/assignments/assignment5.html) in my Computer Organization class at U of Rochester ([CSC 252, Spring 2015](http://cs.rochester.edu/courses/252/spring2015/)). Was working with my partner [ShirMaimon](https://github.com/ShirMaimon) but after our first work session I sorta got carried away and spent the whole night completing it and adding extra features. It can do way more than the assignment asked for, but way less than an actual fully functional proxy server, so this code is probably more useful to learning than for actual use.

I'm not gonna bother covering installation and stuff in detail, but basically you just need to compile ProxyServer.java and then you can run the server with "java ProxyServer [port number]" (if you leave out the port number, it defaults to 8080). There are some final variables at the top of Utils.java that give you some configuration options, and they're documented reasonably well.
